**Dogecoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**

Dogecoin is a popular cryptocurrency that started as a meme but has since gained massive attention and value in the crypto market.
This project aims to predict the closing price of Dogecoin using machine learning techniques — combining data analysis, feature engineering, and time series forecasting (SARIMAX model).


**Project Objectives**

Load and clean Dogecoin historical price data

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Engineer new features correlated with the closing price

Apply SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting

Visualize and compare predictions with actual values



**Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization

sklearn.ensemble – Machine learning algorithms

statsmodels.tsa.statespace – Time series modeling (SARIMAX)



**Dataset**

Name: DOGE-USD

Source: Yahoo Finance

Description: Contains daily historical price data of Dogecoin (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume, Date).
